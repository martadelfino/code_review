# Changes to accommodate suggestions

## Commit 1

- copy in: https://github.qmul.ac.uk/aax010/python-project-template
- only conflict is README, so just mix the two, rename old to `code_review.md` and stick to `docs/`
- create environment with `uv venv` and activate

## Commit 2

- move things around: `assets/` for pictures, `data/` for input/output, `src/` for the scripts
- modify lockfiles/requirements with required libraries.
- Install libraries with `uv`: `uv pip install -r pyproject.toml`
- amend library imports to explicit imports
- amend hard-coded directories to relative directories
