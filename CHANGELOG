# Changes to accommodate suggestions

## Commit 1

- copy in: https://github.qmul.ac.uk/aax010/python-project-template
- only conflict is README, so just mix the two, rename old to `code_review.md` and stick to `docs/`
- create environment with `uv venv` and activate

## Commit 2

- move things around: `assets/` for pictures, `data/` for input/output, `src/` for the scripts
- modify lockfiles/requirements with required libraries.
- Install libraries with `uv`: `uv pip install -r pyproject.toml`
- amend library imports to explicit imports
- amend hard-coded directories to relative directories

## Commit 3

- sample type hinting
- enable Codiumate extension `codium.codium` for testing. Too much coupling

### Suggestions for improvements

- Improve variable naming for clarity, use descriptive names
- use `csv.reader`
- error handling: what happens when expected columns aren't found in the DataFrame? line 33
- use `csvDictWriter`
- use `collections.Counter` lines 86-97
- use `.at` for faster access to a single value
- use type hinting
- use `pathlib` to pass in the output directory, to save images and other data
